        I will eventually make the UI code public, but if you'd like to use it - come find me in Discord. In one project file, you have an original rarity script (not copied from anything) written in typescript, an original templated website built in Angular, and the components to build/view the SVG images and apply the rarities to the base model via SCSS. All code is written by me.
